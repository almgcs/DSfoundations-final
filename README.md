### Hello, visitor!

  This is my [final project](https://almgcs-dsfoundations-final-finalproj-gtxpm3.streamlit.app/) for my Foundations in Data Science graduate class.
  I applied learnings from exploratory data analysis, dimension reduction, and basic machine learning to a Polycistic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) 
  Diagnosis Dataset from Kaggle using Python and Streamlit Sharing.
